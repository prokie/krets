# krets

My SPICE circuit simulator called `krets` written in rust.

I am doing this project to learn rust.

## Supported components

- [ ] BJT
- [x] Capacitor
- [x] Current Source
- [ ] Diode
- [x] Inductor
- [ ] Mosfet
- [ ] Mutual Inductor
- [x] Resistor
- [x] Voltage Source
- [ ] Subcircuit definitions

## Supported analyses

- [x] OP
- [x] DC
- [x] AC
- [ ] Transient
- [ ] Harmonic Balance
- [ ] S parameter analysis

## Order of things TODO

- Add support for Diode
- Add the component VCVS (Voltage Controlled Voltage Source)
- Add the component VCCS (Voltage Controlled Current Source)
- Add the component CCVS (Current Controlled Voltage Source)
- Add the component CCCS (Current Controlled Current Source)
- Add transient analyses
